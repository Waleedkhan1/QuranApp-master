One morning the Prophet ﷺ said, \"Last night two persons (angels) came to me (in a dream) and woke me up and said to me, ‘Proceed!’ I set out with them and we came across a man lying down, and behold, another man was standing over his head, holding a big rock. Behold, he was throwing the rock at the man’s head, smashing it. The rock rolled away and the thrower followed it and took it back. By the time he reached the man, his head returned to its normal state. The thrower then did the same as he had done before. I said to my two companions, ‘Subhan Allâh! Who are these two persons?’ They said, ‘Proceed!’ So we proceeded and came to a man lying in a prone position, and another man standing over his head with an iron hook, and behold, he would put the hook in one side of the man’s mouth and tear off that side of his face to the back (of the neck), and similarly tear his nose from front to back, and his eye from front to back. Then he turned to the other (second) side of the man’s face and did just as he had done with the first side. He hardly completed that (second) side when the first side returned to its normal state. Then he returned to it to repeat what he had done before. I said to my two companions, ‘Subhan Allâh! Who are these two persons?’ They said to me, ‘Proceed!’ So we proceeded and came across something like a Tannur (a kind of baking oven, a pit usually clay-lined for baking bread).\" I think the Prophet ﷺ said, \"In that oven there was much noise and voices.\" The Prophet ﷺ added, \"We looked into it and found naked men and women, and behold, a flame of fire was reaching to them from underneath, and when it reached them, they cried loudly. I asked them, ‘Who are these?’ They said to me, ‘Proceed!’ And so we proceeded and came across a river.\" I think he said, \"- red like blood.\" The Prophet ﷺ added, \"And behold, in the river there was a man swimming, and on the bank there was a man who had collected many stones. Behold, while the other man was swimming, he went near him. The former opened his mouth and the latter (on the bank) threw a stone into his mouth whereupon he went swimming again. Then again he (the former) returned to him (the latter), and every time the former returned, he opened his mouth, and the latter threw a stone into his mouth, (and so on) the performance was repeated. I asked my two companions, ‘Who are these two persons?’ They replied, ‘Proceed! Proceed!’ And we proceeded till we came to a man with a repulsive appearance, the most repulsive appearance you ever saw a man having! Beside him there was a fire, and he was kindling it and running around it. I asked my companions, ‘Who is this (man)?’ They said to me, ‘Proceed! Proceed!’ So we proceeded till we reached a garden of deep green dense vegetation, having all sorts of spring colours. In the midst of the garden there was a very tall man, and I could hardly see his head because of his great height, and around him there were children in such a large number as I have never seen. I said to my companions, ‘Who is this?’ They replied, ‘Proceed! Proceed!’ So we proceeded till we came to a majestic huge garden, greater and better than I have ever seen! My two companions said to me, ‘Ascend up’ and I ascended up.\" The Prophet ﷺ added, \"So we ascended till we reached a city built of gold and silver bricks, and we went to its gate and asked (the gatekeeper) to open the gate, and it was opened and we entered the city and found in it men with one side of their bodies as handsome as the most handsome person you have ever seen, and the other side as ugly as the ugliest person you have ever seen. My two companions ordered those men to throw themselves into the river. Behold, there was a river flowing across (the city), and its water was like milk in whiteness. Those men went and threw themselves in it and then returned to us after the ugliness (of their bodies) had disappeared, and they became in the best shape.\" The Prophet ﷺ further added, \"My two companions (angels) said to me: ‘This place is the ‘Adn Paradise, and that is your place.’ I raised up my sight, and behold, there I saw a palace like a white cloud! My two companions said to me: ‘That (palace) is your place’ I said to them: ‘May Allâh bless you both! Let me enter it.’ They replied, ‘As for now, you will not enter it, but you shall enter it (one day).’ I said to them, ‘I have seen many wonders tonight. What does all that mean which I have seen?’ They replied, ‘We will inform you: As for the first man you came upon whose head was being smashed with the rock, he is the symbol of the one who studies the Qur’ân, and then neither recites it, nor acts on its orders, and sleeps, neglecting the enjoined prayers. As for the man you came upon, whose sides of mouth, nostrils, and eyes were torn off from front to back, he is the symbol of the man who goes out of his house in the morning and tells lies that are spread all over the world. And those naked men and women whom you saw in a construction resembling an oven, they are the adulterers-fornicators and the adulteresses-fornicatresses, and the man whom you saw swimming in the river, and was given a stone to swallow, is the eater of Ribâ (usury), and the bad looking man whom you saw near the fire kindling it and going around it, is Mâlik; the gatekeeper of Hell, and the tall man whom you saw in the garden, is Ibrâhîm (Abraham), and the children around him are those who die on Al-Fitrah (the Islâmic Faith of Monotheism).’ \" The narrator added : Some Muslims asked the Prophet ﷺ Allâh’s Messenger! What about the children of Al-Mushrikûn?*\" The Prophet ﷺ replied, \"And also the children of Al-Mushrikûn.\" The Prophet ﷺ added, \"My two companions added, ‘The men you saw half handsome and half ugly were those persons who had mixed an act that was good with another that was evil, but Allâh forgave them.’ \" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol. 9, Hadîth No. 171). * Al-Mushrikûn: polytheists, pagans, idolaters, and disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh and in His Messenger Muhammad ﷺ."}]}, {"id": "287", "index": "280", "translation": "And if the debtor is in a hard time (has no money), then grant him time till it is easy for him to repay, but if you remit it by way of charity, that is better for you if you did but know.<fn index=\"1\">1</fn>", "footnotes": [{"index": "1", "text": "(V.2:280) Narrated Abu Hurairah رضي الله عنه: Allâh’s Messenger ﷺ said; \"A man used to give loans to the people, and used to say to his servant, ‘If the debtor is poor, forgive him, so that Allâh may forgive us.’ So when he met Allâh (after his death), Allâh forgave him.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhâri, Vol. 4, Hadîth No.687)."}]}, {"id": "288", "index": "281", "translation": "And be afraid of the Day when you shall be brought back to Allâh.

While I was in Shâm, a letter sent by the Prophet ﷺ was brought to Heraclius. Dihya Al-Kalbi had brought and given it to the governor of Busra, and the latter forwarded it to Heraclius. Heraclius said, ‘Is there anyone from the people of this man who claims to be a Prophet?’ The people replied, ‘Yes,’ so, along with some other Quraishi men, I was called and we entered upon Heraclius, and we were seated in front of him. Then he said, ‘Who amongst you is the nearest relative to the man who claims to be a Prophet?’ I (Abu Sufyân) replied: ‘I am the nearest relative to him from amongst the group.’ So they made me sit in front of him and made my companions sit behind me. Then he called upon his translator and said (to him). ‘Tell them (i.e. Abu Sufyân’s companions) that I am going to ask him (i.e. Abu Sufyân) regarding that man who claims to be a Prophet. So, if he tells me a lie, they should contradict him (instantly).’ By Allâh, had I not been afraid that my companions would consider me a liar, I would have told lies. Heraclius then said to his translator, ‘Ask him: What is his (i.e. the Prophet’s) family status amongst you?’ I said, ‘He belongs to a noble family amongst us.’ Heraclius said, ‘Was any of his ancestors a king?’ I said, ‘No’. He said, ‘Did you ever accuse him of telling lies before his saying what he has said?’ I said, ‘No’. He said, ‘Do the nobles follow him or the poor people?’ I said, ‘It is the poor who follow him.’ He said, ‘Is the number of his followers increasing or decreasing?’ I said, ‘They are increasing.’ He said, ‘Does anyone renounce his religion (i.e. Islâm) after embracing it, being displeased with it?’ I said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘Did you fight with him?’ I replied, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘How was your fighting with him?’ I said, ‘The fighting between us was undecided and victory was shared by him and us in turns. He inflicts casualties upon us and we inflict casualties upon him.’ He said, ‘Did he ever betray?’ I said, ‘No, but now we are away from him in this truce and we do not know what he will do in it.’ \" Abu Sufyân added, \"By Allâh, I was not able to insert in my speech a word (against him) except that. Heraclius said, ‘Did anybody else (amongst you) ever claim the same (i.e. to be Allâh’s Prophet) before him?’ I said, ‘No’. Then Heraclius told his translator to tell me (i.e. Abu Sufyân), ‘I asked you about his family status amongst you, and you told me that he comes from a noble family amongst you. Verily, all Messengers come from the noblest family among their people. Then I asked you whether any of his ancestors was a king, and you denied that. Thereupon I thought that had one of his forefathers been a king, I would have said that he (i.e. Muhammad ﷺ) was seeking to rule the kingdom of his forefathers. Then I asked you regarding his followers, whether they were the noble or the poor among the people, and you said that they were only poor (who follow him). In fact, such are the followers of the Messengers. Then I asked you whether you have ever accused him of telling lies before he said what he said, and your reply was in the negative. Therefore, I took for granted that a man who did not tell a lie about others, could never tell a lie about Allâh. Then I asked you whether anyone of his followers had renounced his religion (i.e. Islâm) after embracing it, being displeased with it, and you denied that. And such is faith when its delight enters the heart and mixes with it completely. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing. You claimed that they were increasing, that is the way of true faith till it is complete. Then I asked you whether you had ever fought with him, and you claimed that you had fought with him and the battle between you and him was undecided and the victory was shared by you and him in turns; he inflicted casualties upon you and you inflicted casualties upon them. Such is the case with the Messengers, they are put to trials and the final victory is for them. Then I asked you whether he has ever betrayed anyone; you claimed that he had never betrayed. Indeed, Messengers never betray. Then I asked you whether anyone had said this statement before him; and you denied that. Thereupon I thought if somebody had said that statement before him, then I would have said that he was but a man copying some sayings said before him.’ Abu Sufyân said, \"Heraclius then asked me, ‘What does he order you to do?’ I said, ‘He orders us (to offer) prayers and (to pay) Zakât, and to keep good relationship with the kith and kin, and to be chaste.’ Then Heraclius said, ‘If whatever you have said is true, then he is really a Prophet. I knew that he (i.e. the Prophet ﷺ) was going to appear, but I never thought that he would be from amongst you. If I were certain that I can reach him, I would like to meet him and if I were with him, I would wash his feet; and his kingdom will expand (surely) to what is under my feet.’ Then Heraclius asked for the letter of Allâh’s.

So, He sent them an angel who came to the leper and said, ‘What thing do you like most?’ He replied, ‘Good colour and good skin, for the people have a strong aversion to me.’ The angel touched him and his illness was cured, and he was given a good colour and beautiful skin. The angel asked him, ‘What kind of property do you like best?’ He replied, ‘Camels.’ So he (i.e., the leper) was given a pregnant she-camel, and the angel said (to him), ‘May Allâh bless you in it.’ The angel then went to the bald-headed man and said, ‘What thing do you like most?’ He said, ‘I like good hair and wish to be cured of this disease, for the people feel repulsion for me.’ The angel touched him and his illness was cured, and he was given good hair. The angel asked (him), ‘What kind of property do you like best?’ He replied ‘Cows.’ The angel gave him a pregnant cow and said, ‘May Allâh bless in it.’ The angel went to the blind man and asked, ‘What thing do you like best?’ He said, ‘(I like) that Allâh may restore my eyesight to me so that I may see the people.’ The angel touched his eyes and Allâh gave him back his eyesight. The angel asked him, ‘What kind of property do you like best?’ He replied, ‘Sheep.’ The angel gave him a pregnant sheep. Afterwards, all the three pregnant animals gave birth to young ones, and multiplied and brought forth so much that one of the (three) men had a herd of camels filling a valley, and one had a herd of cows filling a valley, and one had a flock of sheep filling a valley. Then the angel, disguised in the shape and appearance of a leper, went to the leper and said, ‘I am a poor man, who has lost all means of livelihood while on a journey. So none will satisfy my need except Allâh and then you. In the Name of Him Who has given you such nice colour and beautiful skin, and so much property, I ask you to give me a camel so that I may reach my destination.’ The man replied, ‘I have many obligations (so I cannot give you).’ The angel said, ‘I think I know you. Were you not a leper to whom the people had a strong aversion? Weren’t you a poor man, and then Allâh gave you (all this property).’ He replied, ‘(This is all wrong), I got this property through inheritance from my forefathers.’ The angel said, ‘If you are telling a lie then let Allâh make you as you were before.’ Then the angel, disguised in the shape and appearance of a bald man, went to the bald man and said to him the same as he told the first one, and he too answered the same as the first one did. The angel said, ‘If you are telling a lie, then let Allâh make you as you were before.’ The angel, disguised in the shape of a blind man, went to the blind man and said, ‘I am a poor man and a traveller, whose means of livelihood have been exhausted while on a journey. I have nobody to help me except Allâh, and after Him, you yourself. I ask you in the Name of Him Who has given you back your eyesight to give me a sheep, so that with its help, I may complete my journey.’ The man said, ‘No doubt, I was blind and Allâh gave me back my eyesight; I was poor and Allâh made me rich; so take anything you wish from my property. By Allâh, I will not stop you for taking anything (you need) of my property which you may take for Allâh’s sake.’ The angel replied, ‘Keep your property with you.

The Story of the building of the Ka‘bah at Makkah: Narrated Ibn ‘Abbâs رضي الله عنهما : [On the authority of the Prophet ﷺ (See Fath Al-Bari, Vol. 7, Page 210)]. The first lady to use a girdle was the mother of Ismâ‘îl (Ishmael). She used a girdle so that she might hide her tracks from Sârah.* Ibrâhîm (Abraham) brought her and her son Ismâ‘îl (Ishmael) while she used to nurse him at her breast, near the Ka‘bah under a tree on the spot of Zamzam , at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in Makkah, nor was there any water. So he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Ismâ‘îl’s (Ishmael) mother followed him saying, \"O Ibrâhîm (Abraham)! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?\" She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her. Then she asked him, \"Has Allâh ordered you to do so?\" He said, \"Yes.\" She said, \"Then He will not neglect us,\" and returned while Ibrâhîm (Abraham) proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniyyah where they could not see him, he faced the Ka‘bah, and raising both hands invoked Allâh saying the following supplication: ‘O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring to dwell in an uncultivable valley by Your Sacred House (the Ka‘bah at Makkah); in order, O our Lord, that they may perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât). So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allâh) provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks.’ (V.14:37) Ismâ‘îl’s (Ishmael) mother went on suckling Ismâ‘îl (Ishmael) and drinking from the water (she had). When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him [i.e. Ismâ‘îl (Ishmael)] tossing in agony; she left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of As-Safâ was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from As-Safâ and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached Al-Marwah mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between As-Safâ and Al-Marwah) seven times.\" The Prophet ﷺ said, \"This is the source of the tradition of the Sa‘y (the going) of people between them (i.e. As-Safâ and Al-Marwah). When she reached Al-Marwah (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, ‘O (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?’ And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zamzam , digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hands in this way and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it.\" The Prophet ﷺ added, \"May Allâh bestow mercy on Ismâ‘îl’s (Ishmael) mother! Had she let the Zamzam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zamzam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.\" The Prophet ﷺ further added, \"Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, ‘Don’t be afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Allâh which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allâh never neglects His people.’ The House (i.e. Ka‘bah) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kadâ’. They landed in the lower part of Makkah where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, ‘This bird must be flying around water, though we know that there is no water in this valley.’ They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came (towards the water).\" The Prophetﷺ added, \" Ismâ‘îl’s (Ishmael) mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, ‘Do you allow us to stay with you?’ She replied, ‘Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water.’ They agreed to that.\" The Prophet ﷺ further said, \" Ismâ‘îl’s (Ishmael) mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents there. The child [i.e. Ismâ‘îl (Ishmael)] grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them. After Ismâ‘îl’s (Ishmael) mother had died, Ibrâhîm (Abraham) came after Ismâ‘îl’s (Ishmael) marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Ismâ‘îl (Ishmael) there. When he asked Ismâ‘îl’s (Ishmael) wife about him, she replied, ‘He has gone in search of our livelihood.’ Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied, ‘We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution,’ complaining to him. He said, ‘When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house).’ When Ismâ‘îl (Ishmael) came, he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, ‘Has anyone visited you?’ She replied, ‘Yes, an old man of such and such description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty.’ On that Ismâ‘îl (Ishmael) said, ‘Did he advise you anything?’ She replied, ‘Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold of your gate.’ Ismâ‘îl (Ishmael) said, ‘It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family.’ So, Ismâ‘îl (Ishmael) divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum). Then Ibrâhîm (Abraham) stayed away from them for a period as long as Allâh wished and called on them again but did not find Ismâ‘îl (Ishmael). So he came to Ismâ‘îl’s (Ishmael) wife and asked her about Ismâ‘îl (Ishmael). She said, ‘He has gone in search of our livelihood.’ Ibrâhîm (Abraham) asked her, ‘How are you getting on?’ asking her about their sustenance and living. She replied, ‘We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance).’ Then she thanked Allâhعز وجل Ibrâhîm (Abraham) said, ‘What kind of food do you eat?’ She said, ‘Meat.’ He said, ‘What do you drink?’ She said, ‘Water.’ He said, ‘O Allâh! Bless their meat and water.’ \" The Prophet ﷺ added, \"At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allâh to bless it.\" The Prophet ﷺ added, \"If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Makkah.\" The Prophetﷺ added, \"Then Ibrâhîm (Abraham) said to Ismâ‘îl’s (Ishmael) wife, ‘When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate.’ When Ismâ‘îl (Ishmael) came back, he asked his wife, ‘Did anyone call on you?’ She replied, ‘Yes, a good-looking old man came to me,’ so she praised him and added. ‘He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition.’ Ismâ‘îl (Ishmael) asked her, ‘Did he give you any piece of advice?’ She said, ‘Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate.’ On that Ismâ‘îl (Ishmael) said, ‘It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to keep you with me.’ Then Ibrâhîm (Abraham) stayed away from them for a period as long as Allâh wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ismâ‘îl (Ishmael) under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Ibrâhîm (Abraham), he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father). Ibrâhîm (Abraham) said, ‘O Ismâ‘îl (Ishmael)! Allâh has given me an order.’ Ismâ‘îl (Ishmael) said, ‘Do what your Lord has ordered you to do.’ Ibrâhîm (Abraham) asked, ‘Will you help me?’ Ismâ‘îl (Ishmael) said, ‘I will help you.’ Ibrâhîm (Abraham) said, ‘Allâh has ordered me to build a house here,’ pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.’\" The Prophet ﷺ added, \"Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. the Ka‘bah). Ismâ‘îl (Ishmael) brought the stones and Ibrâhîm (Abraham) was building; and when the walls became high, Ismâ‘îl (Ishmael) brought this stone and put it for Ibrâhîm (Abraham) who stood over it and carried on building, while Ismâ‘îl (Ishmael) was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, ‘O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us. Verily, You are the All-Hearer the All-Knower.’\" <reference chapter=\"2\" verses=\"127\">(V.2:127)</reference>.

The man employed another batch after them and said to them, ‘Complete the rest of the day and yours will be the wages I had fixed for the first batch.’ So, they worked till the time of ‘Asr Prayer. They said, ‘Let what we have done be annulled and keep the wages you have promised us for yourself!’ The man said to them, ‘Complete the rest of the work, as only a little of the day remains’: but they refused (like the Christians who refused to believe in the Message of Muhammad ﷺ). Thereafter, he employed another batch to work for the rest of the day, and they worked for the rest of the day till the sunset, and they received the wages of the two former batches. So that was the example of these people (Muslims) and the example of this light [Islâmic Monotheism, the Qur’ân, the Sunnah (legal ways of the Prophet ﷺ) and the guidance which Prophet Muhammad ﷺ brought] which they have accepted willingly.\"* (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.3, Hadith No.471). * The Jews refused to believe in the Message of ‘Îsâ (Jesus), so all their work was annulled; similarly the Christians refused to accept the Message of Muhammad ﷺ and thus their work was annulled too. Such people were not rewarded, because they refused to have true faith for the rest of their lives and died as disbelievers. They should have believed in the latest Message; for their insistence on keeping their old religion deprived them of the reward which they would have got for their previous good deeds achieved before the advent of the new religion.

Narrated Mâlik bin Sa‘sa‘ah رضي الله عنه: The Prophet ﷺ said, \"While I was at the house in a state midway between sleep and wakefulness, (an angel recognized me) as the man lying between two men. A golden tray full of wisdom and belief was brought to me and my body was cut open from the throat to the lower part of the abdomen and then my abdomen was washed with Zamzam water and (my heart was) filled with wisdom and belief. Al-Burâq, a white animal smaller than a mule and bigger than a donkey was brought to me and I set out with Jibrîl (Gabriel). When I reached the nearest heaven, Jibrîl said to the gate-keeper of the heaven, ‘Open the gate.’ The gate-keeper asked, ‘Who is it?’ He said, ‘Jibrîl.’ The gate-keeper, said ‘Who is accompanying you?’ Jibrîl said, ‘Muhammad ﷺ’. The gate-keeper said, ‘Has he been called?’ Jibrîl said, ‘Yes’. Then it was said, ‘He is welcome. What a wonderful visit his is!’ Then I met Adam and greeted him and he said, ‘You are welcome O son and a Prophet.’ Then we ascended to the second heaven. It was asked, ‘Who is it?’ Jibrîl said, ‘Jibrîl.’ It was said, ‘Who is with you?’ He said, ‘Muhammad ﷺ’. It was asked, ‘Has he been sent for?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ It was said, ‘He is welcome. What a wonderful visit his is.’ Then I met ‘Îsâ (Jesus) and Yahyâ (John) who said, ‘You are welcome, O brother and a Prophet.’ Then we ascended to the third heaven. It was asked, ‘Who is it?’ Jibrîl said, ‘Jibrîl.’ It was asked, ‘Who is with you?’ Jibrîl said, ‘Muhammad ﷺ’. It was asked, ‘Has he been sent for?’ Jibrîl said, ‘Yes.’ It was said ‘He is welcome. What a wonderful visit his is!’ (The Prophet ﷺ added:). There I met Yûsuf (Joseph) and greeted him, and he replied, ‘You are welcome, O brother and a Prophet!’ Then we ascended to the fourth heaven and again the same questions and answers were exchanged as in the previous heavens. There I met Idrîs (Enoch) and greeted him. He said, ‘You are welcome O brother and Prophet.’ Then we ascended to the fifth heaven and again the same questions and answers were exchanged as in the previous heavens. There I met and greeted Hârûn (Aaron) who said, ‘You are welcome, O brother and a Prophet.’ Then we ascended to the sixth heaven and again the same questions and answers were exchanged as in the previous heavens. There I met and greeted Mûsâ (Moses) who said, ‘You are welcome, O brother and a Prophet.’ When I proceeded on, he started weeping and on being asked why he was weeping, he said, ‘O Lord! followers of this youth who was sent after me will enter Paradise in greater number than my followers.’ Then we ascended to the seventh heaven and again the same questions and answers were exchanged as in the previous heavens. There I met and greeted Abraham who said, ‘You are welcome, O son and a Prophet.’ Then I was shown Al-Bait Al-Ma‘mûr (i.e. Allah’s House). I asked Jibrîl about it and he said, ‘This is Al-Bait Al-Ma‘mûr where 70,000 angels perform prayers daily; and when they leave they never return to it (but always a fresh batch comes into it daily).’ Then I was shown Sidrat-ul Muntaha (i.e. the lote-tree of the utmost boundary over the seventh heaven) and I saw its Nabiq fruits which resembled the clay jugs of Hajar (a town in Arabia), and its leaves were like the ears of elephants, and four rivers originated at its root: two of them were apparent and two were hidden. I asked Jibrîl about those rivers and he said, ‘The two hidden rivers are in Paradise and the apparent ones are the Nile and the Euphrates.’ Then fifty prayers were enjoined on me. I descended till I met Mûsâ who asked me, ‘What have you done?’ I said, ‘Fifty prayers have been enjoined on me.’ He said, ‘I know the people better than you, because I had the hardest experience to bring Banî Israel to obedience. Your followers cannot put up with such obligation. So, return to your Lord and request Him (to reduce the number of prayers).’ I returned and requested Allah (for reduction) and He made it forty. I returned and [met Mûsâ] and had a similar discussion, and then returned again to Allah for reduction and He made it thirty, then twenty, then ten; and then I came to Mûsâ! who repeated the same advice. Ultimately Allah reduced it to five. When I came to Mûsâ again, he said, ‘What have you done?’ I said, ‘Allah has made it five only.’ He repeated the same advice but I said that I surrendered (to Allah’s Final Order)\" Allah’s Messenger ﷺ was addressed by Allah, \"I have decreed My Obligation and have reduced the burden on My slaves, and I shall reward a single good deed as if it were ten good deeds.\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 4, Hadîth No.429)."}]}, {"id": "4797", "index": "13", "translation": "And indeed he (Muhammad ﷺ) saw him [Jibrîl (Gabriel)] at a second descent (i.e. another time)."}, {"id": "4798", "index": "14", "translation": "Near Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (a lote-tree of the utmost boundary over the seventh heaven beyond which none can pass)."}, {"id": "4799", "index": "15", "translation": "Near it is the Paradise of Abode."}, {"id": "4800", "index": "16", "translation": "When that covered the lote-tree which did cover it!<fn index=\"1\">1</fn>", "footnotes": [{"index": "1", "text": "(V.53:16) It is said that the Lot-Tree was covered with the light of Allah along with the angels and also with different kinds of colours.

Such a one will try to prostrate himself (on the Day of Judgement) but his back (bones) will become a single (vertebra) bone (so he will not be able to prostrate). (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.6, Hadîth No.441). b) See the footnote of <reference chapter=\"3\" verses=\"73\">(V.3:73)</reference> صفات الله . c) Narrated Abu Sa‘îd Al-Khudrî رضي الله عنه: We said, \"O Allâh’s Messenger! Shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?\" He said, \"Do you have any difficulty in seeing the sun and the moon when the sky is clear?\" We said, \"No.\" He said, \"So you will have no difficulty in seeing your Lord on that Day as you have no difficulty in seeing the sun and the moon (in a clear sky).\" The Prophet ﷺ then said, \"Somebody will then announce, ‘Let every nation follow what they used to worship.’ So the people of the Cross will go with their Cross, and the idolaters (will go) with their idols, and the worshippers of every god (false deities) (will go) with their god: till there remain those who used to worship Allâh, from the righteous pious ones and the mischievous ones, and some of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians). Then Hell will be presented to them as if it were a mirage. Then it will be said to the Jews, ‘What did you use to worship?’ They will reply, ‘We used to worship ‘Uzair (Ezra), the son of Allâh.’ It will be said to them, ‘You are liars, for Allâh has neither a wife nor a son. What do you want (now)?’ They will reply, ‘We want You to provide us with water.’ Then it will be said to them ‘Drink’, and they will fall down in Hell (instead). Then it will be said to the Christians, ‘What did you use to worship?’ They will reply, ‘We used to worship Messiah, the son of Allâh.’ It will be said, ‘You are liars, for Allâh has neither a wife nor a son. What do you want (now)?’ They will say, ‘We want You to provide us with water.’ It will be said to them, ‘Drink,’ and they will fall down in Hell (instead): till there remain only those who used to worship Allâh (Alone), from the righteous pious ones and the mischievous evil ones, it will be said to them, ‘What keeps you here when all the people have gone?’ They will say, ‘We left them (in the world) when we were in greater need of them than we are today; we heard the call of one proclaiming - Let every nation follow what they used to worship, - and now we are waiting for our Lord.’ Then the Almighty will come to them in a shape other than the one which they saw the first time, and He will say, ‘I am your Lord,’ and they will say, ‘You are our Lord.’ And none will speak to Him then but the Prophets. And then it will be said to them, ‘Do you know any sign by which you can recognise Him?’ They will say, ‘The Shin,’ and so Allâh will then uncover His Shin whereupon every believer will prostrate himself before Him and there will remain those who used to prostrate themselves before Him just for showing off and for gaining good reputation. Such a one will try to prostrate himself but his back (bones) will become a single (vertebra) bone [like one piece of a wood and he will not be able to prostrate]. Then the bridge will be brought and laid across Hell.\" We (the Companions of the Prophet ﷺ) said, \"O Allâh’s Messenger! What is the bridge?\" He said, \"It is a slippery (bridge) on which there are clamps and (hooks like) a thorny seed that is wide at one side and narrow at the other and has thorns with bent ends. Such a thorny seed is found in Najd and is called As-Sa‘dân. Some of the believers will cross the bridge as quickly as the wink of an eye, some others as quick as lightning, or a strong wind, or fast horses or she-camels. So some will be safe without any harm; some will be safe after receiving some scratches and some will fall down into Hell (Fire). The last person will cross as if being dragged (over the bridge).\" The Prophet ﷺ said, \"You (Muslims) cannot be more pressing in claiming from me a right that has been clearly proved to be yours than the believers in interceding with Almighty for their (Muslim) brothers on that Day, when they see themselves safe. They will say, ‘O Allâh! (Save) our brothers (for they) used to pray with us, fast with us and also do good deeds with us.’ Allâh will say, ‘Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find Faith equal to the weight of one (gold) Dinar.’ Allâh will forbid the Fire to burn the faces of those sinners. They will go to them and find some of them in Hell (Fire) up to their feet, and some up to the middle of their legs. So, they will take out those whom they will recognise and then they will return. And Allâh will say (to them), ‘Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find Faith equal to the weight of one-half Dinar.’ They will take out whomever they will recognise and return. And then Allâh will say, ‘Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find Faith equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant), and so they will take out all those whom they will recognise.\" Abû Sa‘îd said: \"If you do not believe me then read the Holy Verse: ‘Surely Allâh wrongs not even of the weight of an atom (or a small ant) but if there is any good (done), He doubles it.’ <reference chapter=\"4\" verses=\"40\">(V.4:40)</reference>.\" The Prophet ﷺ added: \"Then the Prophets and angels and the believers will intercede, and (last of all) the Almighty (Allâh) will say, ‘Now remains My Intercession. He will then hold a handful of the Fire from which He will take out some people whose bodies have been burnt, and they will be thrown into a river at the entrance of Paradise, called the Water of Life. They will grow on its banks, as a seed carried by the torrent grows. You have noticed how it grows beside a rock or beside a tree, and how the side facing the sun is usually green while the side facing the shade is white. Those people will come out (of the River of Life) like pearls, and they will have (golden) necklaces, and then they will enter Paradise whereupon the people of Paradise will say, ‘These are the people emancipated by the Gracious. He has admitted them into Paradise without (them) having done any good deed and without sending forth any good (for themselves).’ Then it will be said to them, ‘For you is what you have seen and its equivalent as well.’\" (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.9, Hadîth No.532B)."}]}, {"id": "5314", "index": "43", "translation": "Their eyes will be cast down and ignominy will cover them; they used to be called to prostrate themselves (offer prayers), while they were healthy and good (in the life of the world, but they did not)."}, {"id": "5315", "index": "44", "translation": "Then leave Me Alone with such as belie this Qur’ân.

Narrated Shu‘aib رضي الله عنه : Allâh’s Messenger ﷺ said: \"Among the people before you, there was a king and he had a sorcerer. When the sorcerer became old, he said to the king: ‘I have now become an old man, get me a boy so that I may teach him sorcery.’ So the king sent him a boy to teach him sorcery. Whenever the boy proceeded to the sorcerer, he sat with a monk who was on the way and listened to his talks and used to admire them (those talks). So when he went to the sorcerer, he passed by the monk and sat there with him. And on visiting the sorcerer, the latter thrashed him. So the boy complained about that to the monk. The monk said to him: Whenever you are afraid of the sorcerer, say to him: ‘My people kept me busy’; and whenever you are afraid of your people, say to them: ‘The sorcerer kept me busy.’ So the boy carried on like that (for a period). \"There came (on the main road) a huge creature (animal), and the people were unable to pass by. The boy said: ‘Today I will know whether the sorcerer is better or the monk’. So he took a stone and said: ‘O Allâh! If the deeds and actions of the monk are liked by You better than those of the sorcerer, then kill this creature so that the people can cross (the road).’ Then he hit (it) with the stone, and it was killed and the people passed (the road). The boy came to the monk and informed him about it. The monk said to him: ‘O my son! Today you are better than I; you have achieved what I see! And you will be put to trial. And in case you are put to trial, do not inform (them) about me.’ The boy used to treat the people suffering from born-blindness, leprosy, leucoderma, and other diseases. A blind courtier of the king heard about the boy. He came and brought a number of gifts for the boy and said: ‘All these gifts are for you on condition that you cure me’. The boy said: ‘I do not cure anybody; it is only Allâh (Alone) Who cures (people). So if you believe in Allâh, and invoke Allâh, He will cure you’. He then believed in Allâh, and Allâh cured him. Later the courtier came to the king, and sat at the place where he used to sit before. The king asked him: ‘Who has given you your sight back?’ The courtier replied: ‘My Lord (Allâh)!’ The king said: ‘Have you got another lord than I?’ The courtier said: ‘My Lord and your Lord is Allâh!’ The king got hold of him and kept on tormenting him till he informed him about the boy. So the boy was brought. The king said to the boy: ‘O boy! Has your (knowledge of) sorcery reached to the extent that you cure born-blinds, lepers, leucodermic patients and do such and such?’ The boy replied: ‘I do not cure anybody; it is only Allâh (Alone) Who does cure’. Then the king got hold of him, and kept on tormenting him till he informed him about the monk. And the monk was brought, and it was said to him: ‘Give up your religion (turn apostate)!’ The monk refused to turn apostate. Then the king ordered (to be bring) a saw, and it was put in the middle of his scalp and was sawn, till he fell. cut in two pieces. Then that courtier was brought, and it was said to him: ‘Give up your religion (turn apostate)!’ The courtier refused to turn apostate. So the saw was put in the middle of his scalp, and was sawn till he fell, cut in two pieces. Then the boy was brought, and it was said to him: ‘Give up your religion (turn apostate)!’ The boy refused to turn apostate. So the king ordered some of his courtiers to take the boy to such and such a mountain saying, ‘Then ascend up the mountain with him till you reach its top, and see if he turns apostate (from his religion, well and good); otherwise throw him down from its top.’ They took him, ascended up the mountain, and the boy said: ‘O Allâh! Save me from them by anything You wish!’ So the mountain shook and all of them fell down, and the boy came walking to the king. The king asked him: ‘What did your companions do?’ The boy said: ‘Allâh has saved me from them.’ The king then ordered some of his courtiers to take the boy on board a boat into the middle of the sea, saying, ‘Then if he turns apostate (from his religion, well and good), otherwise cast him into the sea.’ So they took him, and he said: ‘O Allâh! Save me from them by anything You wish.’ So the boat capsized, and (all the accompanying courtiers) were drowned. The boy then came walking to the king. The king said: ‘What did your companions do?’ The boy replied: ‘Allâh saved me from them’, and he further said to the king: ‘You cannot kill me till you do what I command!’ The king said: ‘What is that (command of yours)?’ The boy said: ‘Gather all the people in an upland place, and fasten me to the stem (of a tree); then take an arrow from my quiver and fix it in the bow, and say: - In the Name of Allâh, the Lord of the boy, - and shoot (me). If you do that, you will kill me.’ So the king gathered the people in an upland place, and fastened the boy to the stem, took an arrow from his quiver, fixed it in the bow, and said: ‘In the Name of Allâh, the Lord of the boy’, and shot the arrow. The arrow hit the temporal region of the skull of the boy, and the boy put his hand over the temporal region of his skull at the point where the arrow hit, and then died. The people proclaimed: ‘We have believed in the Lord of the boy! We have believed in the Lord of the boy! We have believed in the Lord of the boy!’ The king came, and it was said to him: ‘That is the thing which you were afraid of. By Allâh! The thing which you were afraid of, has fallen upon you, the people have believed (in Allâh).’ So he ordered (deep) ditches to be dug at the entrances of the roads, and it was done, then fire was kindled in those ditches, and the king ordered that whoever did not turn apostate (from his religion) be cast into the ditches, and it was done. Then there came a woman with her babe. She nearly retreated back from the ditch but the babe said (spoke): ‘O mother! Be patient, you are on the Truth,’ (So she threw herself in the ditch of the fire along with her child to be with the martyrs in the Paradise).\" (Sahih Muslim, Vol.4, Hadith No.7148)."}]}, {"id": "5914", "index": "5", "translation": "Of fire fed with fuel,"}, {"id": "5915", "index": "6", "translation": "When they sat by it (fire),"}, {"id": "5916", "index": "7", "translation": "And they witnessed what they were doing against the believers (i.e. burning them)."}, {"id": "5917", "index": "8", "translation": "And they had no fault except that they believed in Allâh, the All-Mighty, Worthy of all Praise!"}, {"id": "5918", "index": "9", "translation": "To Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth!

This incident happened during the period of the birth-year of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. Abrahah Al-Ashram was the governor of Yemen on behalf of the king of Ethiopia (as Yemen was a part of the Ethiopian kingdom). He (Abrahah) thought to build a house (like the Ka‘bah at Makkah) in San‘a (the capital of Yemen) and call the Arabs to perform the pilgrimage there in San‘a instead of the Ka‘bah (Al-Bait Al-Harâm) in Makkah, with the intention of diverting the trade and benefits from Makkah to Yemen. He presented his idea to the king of Ethiopia who agreed to his idea. So the house (church) was built and he named it Al-Qullais; there was no church of its like at that time. Then a man from the Quraish tribe of Makkah came there and was infuriated by it, so he relieved his nature (stools and urine) in it, soiled its walls and went away. When Abrahah Al-Ashram saw that, he could not control his anger and raised an army to invade Makkah and demolish the Ka‘bah. He had in that army thirteen elephants and amongst them was an elephant called Mahmûd which was the biggest of them. So that army proceeded and none amongst the Arab tribes that faced them (fought against them) but was killed and defeated, till it approached near Makkah. Then there took place negotiations between Abrahah Al-Ashram and the chief of Makkah (Abdul Muttalib bin Hâshim, the grandfather of the Prophet ﷺ), and it was concluded that Abrahah would restore the camels of Abdul Muttalib which he had taken away, and then he (Abrahah Al-Ashram) would decide himself as regards the Ka‘bah. Abdul Muttalib ordered the men of Makkah to evacuate the city and go to the top of the mountains along with their wives and children in case some harm should come to them from the invading oppressors. Then that army moved towards Makkah till they reached valley Muhassir. While the army was marching towards Makkah, in the middle of the valley, suddenly it was overtaken by flocks of birds, flocks after flocks, air-raiding that army with small stones slightly bigger than a lentil seed. There never fell a stone on a soldier except it dissolved his flesh and burst it into pieces. So they perished with a total destruction. Abrahah Al-Ashram fled away while his flesh was bursting into pieces till he died on the way (back to Yemen). Such was the victory bestowed by Allâh, (the All-Majestic, All-Powerful) to the people of Makkah and such was the protection provided by Him for His House (Ka‘bah in Makkah).
