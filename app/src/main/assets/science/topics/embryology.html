And they followed the guidance of the Holy Qur'an in Surah Furqan, Chapter No. 25, Verse 59, which says:<br><br><i>“If you are in doubt, ask the person who knows... ask the person who is knowledgeable.”</i></p><div class="reference">{{REF_AR=25:59}}<p class="translation">{{REF_TR=25:59}}</p><div class="footer"><span>{{REF_NAME=25:59}}</span><span class="sep"></span><a href="https://quranapp.verse.reader/25/59">Open in reader</a></div></div><p>So they took all the data given in the Holy Qur'an dealing with <b>‘Embryology’</b>, and presented it to Professor Keith Moore. Professor Keith Moore is the head and chairman of the department of Anatomy, in the University of Toronto in Canada, and is one of the leading authorities in the world in the field of Embryology.<br><br>When Professor Keith Moore went through the translation of the various Verses No. of the Qur'an, dealing with Embryology, he said, that most of the things which the Qur'an speaks about Embryology is matching with the latest discoveries made in the field of Embryology, but there are a couple of things, which I cannot say that they are right. Neither can I say that they are wrong, because I myself do not know about it.<br><br>And one such Verse, was from Surah Iqra, or Surah Alaq, Chapter No. 96, Verse No. 1 and 2 which says:<br><br><i>“Read, Recite or Proclaim, in the name of thy Lord, who created - who created the human beings from something which clings - a leech like substance”</i></p><div class="reference">{{REF_AR=96:1}}<p class="translation">{{REF_TR=96:1}}</p><div class="footer"><span>{{REF_NAME=96:1}}</span><span class="sep"></span><a href="https://quranapp.verse.reader/96/1">Open in reader</a></div></div><div class="reference">{{REF_AR=96:2}}<p class="translation">{{REF_TR=96:2}}</p><div class="footer"><span>{{REF_NAME=96:2}}</span><span class="sep"></span><a href="https://quranapp.verse.reader/96/2">Open in reader</a></div></div><p>So Professor Keith Moore said, I do not know whether the embryo looks like a leech or not. So he went in his laboratory and under a very powerful microscope, examined the shape of the early stage of Embryo, and compared it with a photograph of a leech, and he was astonished at the striking resemblance. And when he was asked about 80 questions on Embryology taken from the Holy Qur'an and Hadith, he said… ‘that if you would have asked me all these things 0 years ago, I would not be able to answer more than 50% of this. Because Embryology… the development of Embryology, is just recently, hardly 0 to 50 years, it is advanced’. And Professor Keith Moore, he had written a book - 'The Developing Human'… and in his new edition, the 3rd edition, he has incorporated the new things which he found from the Qur'an and the Hadith for which he got an award for the best medical book written in that year by any single author.<br><br>And when I was doing my MBBS in the first year, we referred to this book 'Developing Human' by Keith Moore. If we wanted to score high marks, in<b>‘Embryology’</b>, we referred to the book by Keith Moore. If we wanted to get just passing marks, we referred to Inderbir Singh but if we wanted to score, we had to refer to the book by Professor Keith Moore. And later on this book was translated into several languages of the world. Professor Keith Moore said, “I have got no objection, in accepting that Prophet Muhammed (pbuh) is the messenger of God Almighty, and that the Holy Qur'an has to be a Divine Revelation”</p><hr><h3 id="sperm">MAN CREATED FROM A DROP EMITTED FROM BETWEEN THE BACK BONE AND THE RIBS</h3><p>The Holy Qur'an says in Surah Tariq Chapter No. 86, Verse No. 5 to 7:<br><br><i>“Let now man think from what he is created, he is created from a drop, emitted from a space between the backbone and the ribs.”</i></p><div class="reference">{{REF_AR=86:5}}<p class="translation">{{REF_TR=86:5}}</p><div class="footer"><span>{{REF_NAME=86:5}}</span><span class="sep"></span><a href="https://quranapp.verse.reader/86/5">Open in reader</a></div></div><div class="reference">{{REF_AR=86:6}}<p class="translation">{{REF_TR=86:6}}</p><div class="footer"><span>{{REF_NAME=86:6}}</span><span class="sep"></span><a href="https://quranapp.verse.reader/86/6">Open in reader</a></div></div><div class="reference">{{REF_AR=86:7}}<p class="translation">{{REF_TR=86:7}}</p><div class="footer"><span>{{REF_NAME=86:7}}</span><span class="sep"></span><a href="https://quranapp.verse.reader/86/7">Open in reader</a></div></div><p>Today we have come to know, the genital organs, the testes, in the males, and the ovaries in the female, in the Embryonic stage they develop from a space, where the kidney is present today, between the backbone and the 11th and 12th rib.

The Qur'an has mentioned this 1400 years ago.<br><br>In our society, specially in the Indian society, for reasons known best to them, people prefer having a male child. And suppose the daughter in law, if she gives birth to a female child, the mother-in-law normally blames the daughter-in-law. If the motherin-law has to blame anyone, she should blame the son, not the daughter-in-law… because the Holy Qur'an and science tells us, that it is the male which is responsible for the sex of the child and not the female.<br><br>The Qur'an describes the various Embryological stages in great detail.

It starts with saying…<br><br><i>“We have placed the <b>‘Nutfah’</b> the minute quantity into <b>‘Qaraare Makeen’</b>, a place of security”</i><br><br>Today Embryology tells us that the Embryo is protected posteriorly by the back bone and the posterior muscles of the mother - anteriorly by the anterior abdominal wall, by the uterine wall as well as the Amnio-Chorionic Membrane. It continues… “then we made it into an <b>‘Alaqa’</b>, a leech like substance, something which clings”<br><br>The Arabic word <b>‘Alaqa’</b>, has got meanings: something which clings, a leech like substance, as well as blood clot. Alhamdulillah, all three meanings are applicable here, because the Embryo, in the initial stages it clings to the uterine wall of the mother. It looks like a <b>‘leech’</b>, as confirmed by Professor Keith Moore. It also behaves like a <b>‘leech’</b>, it behaves like a blood sucker, it derives the blood supply and the nutrition from the mother. And at this stage if an abortion takes place, the concept is, it looks like a blood clot. It looks like a blood clot as well as a leech. So Qur'an, in one word it implies three meanings, which all are applicable.<br><br>Qur'an mentions this word <b>‘Alaqa’</b> no less then six times.</p><ul><li><a href="https://quranapp.verse.ref/23/12-14">Twice in Surah Muminun, Chapter No. 23, Verse No. 12 to 14;</a></li><li><a href="https://quranapp.verse.ref/22/5">Surah Hajj, Chapter No. 22, Verse No 5;</a></li><li><a href="https://quranapp.verse.ref/40/67">Surah Ghafir, Chapter No. 40, Verse 67;</a></li><li><a href="https://quranapp.verse.ref/75/38">Surah Qiyamah, Chapter No. 75, Verse 38; as well as in</a></li><li><a href="https://quranapp.verse.ref/96/2">Surah Iqra, Chapter No. 96, Verse No 2.</a></li></ul><p>Previously, in the 17th century people thought that the sperm, it walled a miniature human being. A miniature human being was present in the head of the sperm, which later on developed into the uterus of the mother, as a new born baby. This was believed by Flaumadam, who proposed the <b>‘Perforation theory’</b>. Later on, when they discovered that the ovum is bigger than the sperm, D Graphy and others, they said it is not the sperm which walls a miniature human being, it is the ovum which walls a miniature human being. Later on, Maopertuis in the eighteen century, he proposed the <b>‘Bi-parental theory’</b> that both are responsible. As the Qur'an says, both the sperm and the ovum is responsible for the birth of the child. Qur'an says, we made that<b>‘Alaqa’</b>, into a <b>‘Mudga’</b>. <b>‘Mudga’</b> means <b>‘chewed like lump’</b>, or something tacky which can be put in the mouth. Professor Keith Moore said, ‘both these meanings are applicable, because it is something tacky which can be put in the mouth’ and later on he took a plaster seal and bit it between his teeth, to look like a Mudga, ‘a chewed like lump’. And he was astonished that the teeth marks resembled the <b>‘Somites’</b>, from which develops the spinal column. The Qur'an says, 'We made that <b>‘Mudga’</b>into <b>‘Izama’</b>… bones. We clothed the <b>‘Izaman’</b> with <b>‘lahem’</b>… flesh, and muscles.<br><br><i>Allah says then, “We create the <b>‘Al-Nasha’</b> stage, We create a new creature”</i><br><br>What does the Qur'an mean … <b>‘We have created a new creature’</b>?. Science today tells us that the embryological stages of development, before this stage, in the rabbit, in the fish, in the other animals, it is similar to that of human beings. It is only at this stage of <b>‘Al-Nasha’</b>, that the particular characteristics of the human beings are seen... the head, the hands and the feet. The Qur'an says… ‘We have made a new creature’, and ends by saying... <b>‘Blessed is He, who is the best to create’</b>. Imagine, Qur'an gives the various Embryological stages in great detail.<br><br>There was a person who put forward an argument... ‘It is nothing new; may be some Arab, he opened up the abdomen of a pregnant woman and checked the shape and wrote in the Qur'an’. He did not realise that all these stages, which the Qur'an describes, it cannot be observed with the naked human eye, you require a very powerful microscope. When Professor Marshall Johnson was asked to comment of these erses... He is the head of the department of <b>‘Anatomy’</b> in the Daniel Institute, in Sir Thomas Jefferson's hospital in Philadelphia, USA. He said ‘It can be possible that Prophet Muhammed (pbuh), he had a microscope and he observed it’. Then, he was reminded that… <b>‘Microscope was not invented 1400 years ago’</b>. So, Professor Marshall Johnson laughed loudly, and he said ‘Yes, I know that. And I have seen the first microscope with my own eyes, it hardly enlarges to ten times and the picture is not even clear. Then he said, “These stages has to be a Divine Revelation”.</p><hr><h3 id="embryo-form">EMBRYO PARTLY FORMED AND PARTLY UNFORMED</h3><p>Professor Marshall Johnson was further asked to comment on the verse of the Qur'an from Surah Hajj, Chapter No. 22, Verse No 5, which says:<br><br><i>“We have created the human beings from dust then made it into an <b>‘Alaqa’</b>, made it into a <b>‘Mudga’</b>, partly formed and partly unformed”</i></p><div class="reference">{{REF_AR=22:5}}<p class="translation">{{REF_TR=22:5}}</p><div class="footer"><span>{{REF_NAME=22:5}}</span><span class="sep"></span><a href="https://quranapp.verse.reader/22/5">Open in reader</a></div></div><p>When you take an incision at this stage, and analyze the Embryo and cut up the internal organs, you will find out that the internal organs at this particular stage, some of the organs are formed while the other organs, they aren’t formed. So Professor Marshall Johnson said, If I said, that it is a complete creation, I am only describing those organs which are formed. If I say it is an incomplete creation, I am only describing those organs which are not formed. There can be no better description than the Holy Qur'an, saying… “Partly formed and partly unformed”, because some organs are formed, the others are not formed… some cells are differentiated, the others are not differentiated’.<br><br>Professor Keith Moore said, that… ‘Today in Embryology we have got several stages of the Embryological development, but it is so difficult to understand it, because it has got numerical stages - stage 1, stage 2, stage 3. The Qur'an bases the stages on shapes, and predated development, which is far superior and easy than what modern Embryology has done today. If the Embryologists… they describe according to the stages of the Qur'an, it is far more easier for them to describe and understand, than what modern Embryology has done - stage 1, stage 2, stage 3.<br><br>The Qur'an says in Surah Abasa, Chapter No. 80, Verse 19 and 20:<br><br><i>“We have created the human beings from minute quantity and We have made the passage of birth easy.”</i></p><div class="reference">{{REF_AR=80:19}}<p class="translation">{{REF_TR=80:19}}</p><div class="footer"><span>{{REF_NAME=80:19}}</span><span class="sep"></span><a href="https://quranapp.verse.reader/80/19">Open in reader</a></div></div><div class="reference">{{REF_AR=80:20}}<p class="translation">{{REF_TR=80:20}}</p><div class="footer"><span>{{REF_NAME=80:20}}</span><span class="sep"></span><a href="https://quranapp.verse.reader/80/20">Open in reader</a></div></div><p>People normally wonder, that how can the birth canal which hardly admits 3 to 4 fingers, how can a baby come out of it? The bony structure is so rigid, it has got Ligament... How is it possible? Qur'an says… <b>‘Allah makes the pathway easy’</b>. And today we have come to know that... How is it possible. Relaxin is being secreted by the ovaries and the placenta which loosens the ligament of the pelvic joints and softens the cervix. The uterine contraction that takes place, it pushes the baby downwards in the birth canal. The bag of water which ruptures, it provides a slippery surface for the baby to come out, to slide and the various movements of the baby, while birth facilitates the movement through the irregular pelvic joints.<br><br>The Qur'an says that… <b>‘Allah makes the pathway easy’</b>.
