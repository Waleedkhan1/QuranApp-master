<h1>Geology</h1><h3>MOUNTAINS ARE LIKE PEGS (STAKES)</h3><p>Let us discuss the field of Geology. Today the Geologists, they tell us that the earth we live on, the outer crust it's hard and solid, and the deeper layers they are hot and fluid and inhospitable for the existence of living creatures. The Geologists, they tell us that outer crust is very thin, hardly 1 to 10 miles less than one percent of the radius of the earth, which is 3750 miles. And the outer crust is very thin and there are high possibilities of it shaking. Today Geologists tell us, it is due to the <b>‘folding phenomena’</b>, which gives rise to mountain ranges and these mountains, they prevent the earth from shaking; they act as <b>‘pegs’</b> as <b>‘stakes’</b>.<br><br>The Holy Qur'an says in Surah Naba, Chapter No. 78, Verse No. 6 and 7, it says:<br><br><i>“We have made the earth as an expanse”,<br>“And the mountains as stakes’.</i></p><div class="reference">{{REF_AR=78:6}}<p class="translation">{{REF_TR=78:6}}</p><div class="footer"><span>{{REF_NAME=78:6}}</span><span class="sep"></span><a href="https://quranapp.verse.reader/78/6">Open in reader</a></div></div><div class="reference">{{REF_AR=78:7}}<p class="translation">{{REF_TR=78:7}}</p><div class="footer"><span>{{REF_NAME=78:7}}</span><span class="sep"></span><a href="https://quranapp.verse.reader/78/7">Open in reader</a></div></div><p>The Arabic word <b>‘Avtaad’</b>, means <b>‘Stakes’</b>, means <b>‘Pegs’</b> which we have discovered today.<br><br>The Holy Qur'an says in Surah Jashiya, Chapter No. 88, Verse No. 19, as well as in Surah Naziat, Chapter No. 79, Verse No. 32, it says:<br><br><i>“We have made the mountain standing firm.”,</i></p><div class="reference">{{REF_AR=79:32}}<p class="translation">{{REF_TR=79:32}}</p><div class="footer"><span>{{REF_NAME=79:32}}</span><span class="sep"></span><a href="https://quranapp.verse.reader/79/32">Open in reader</a></div></div><p>There is a book by the title 'The Earth' which is a very famous book … an authority in this field, which is referred by most of the Universities throughout the world, in this subject.
