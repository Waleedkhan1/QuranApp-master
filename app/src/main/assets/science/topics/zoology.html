Verse No. 79:<br><br><i>“Do you not look at the bird subjected in the midst in the air? None of them can hold them up except with the power of Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala”</i></p><div class="reference">{{REF_AR=16:79}}<p class="translation">{{REF_TR=16:79}}</p><div class="footer"><span>{{REF_NAME=16:79}}</span> <span class="sep"></span><a href="https://quranapp.verse.reader/16/79">Open in reader</a></div></div><p>The Qur'an repeats in Surah Mulk, Chapter No. 67, Verse No. 19:<br><br><i>“Do you not observe the birds above you? They spread their wings and they fold it. None can hold them up except with the power of Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta’ala, and He watches over all things.”</i></p><div class="reference">{{REF_AR=67:19}}<p class="translation">{{REF_TR=67:19}}</p><div class="footer"><span>{{REF_NAME=67:19}}</span> <span class="sep"></span><a href="https://quranapp.verse.reader/67/19">Open in reader</a></div></div><p>This verse of the Holy Qur'an there is a very striking resemblance with what modern science has discovered today, that the birds have got a certain migratory programming in their nervous system. That is the reason that young birds, without any prior experience, can take flights of thousands of miles without a guide and they come back to the departure point also. And a very good example is given by Professor Hamburger in his book <b>‘Power and fragility of the Mutton bird’</b>. The Mutton bird lives in the Pacific, it has a journey of more than 15,000 miles, and it takes about six months, and it comes back to the departure point in a delay of not more than one week. How is it possible? Scientists say, “there has to be a certain programming of these birds” Who is programming them? But natural, as the Holy Qur'an says ‘Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta’ala holds them up’... the Arabic word 'Amsaka' meaning to seize or to hold.</p><hr><h3 id="bee">THE BEE</h3><p>The Qur'an says in Surah Nahl, Chapter No. 16, Verse No. 68 and 69:<br><br><i>“It is the Lord who has taught the bees to build cells, in hills, in trees and human habitations and to eat of what the earth produces, and to find the spacious path of the Lord, with great skill”</i></p><div class="reference">{{REF_AR=16:68}}<p class="translation">{{REF_TR=16:68}}</p><div class="footer"><span>{{REF_NAME=16:68}}</span> <span class="sep"></span><a href="https://quranapp.verse.reader/16/68">Open in reader</a></div></div><div class="reference">{{REF_AR=16:69}}<p class="translation">{{REF_TR=16:69}}</p><div class="footer"><span>{{REF_NAME=16:69}}</span> <span class="sep"></span><a href="https://quranapp.verse.reader/16/69">Open in reader</a></div></div><p>What does the Qur'an mean by… ‘Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta’ala has taught the bee to find the spacious path of the Lord?’ on Frisch, who is a scientist, he got the Noble Prize, in 1973, when he described the behavior of the animals, especially the communication method of the bee. And today we have come to know that whenever a worker bee finds a new flower or a new garden from where it can take nectar, it goes and tells its fellow bees the exact direction and map of that new flower or garden... it is called as the <b>‘bee dance’</b>. Only today, we have come to know by high photographic method, how is this communication given.<br><br>The gender used in the Holy Qur'an in these Verses of Surah Nahl, Chapter No. 16, erse 8, and 9 is a female gender <b>‘Quli’</b>, or <b>‘Fasluki’</b> which means a <b>‘Female bee’</b>. Previously we thought it was the male bee which was the worker bee. No wonder, Shakespeare in his play <b>‘Henry the I ’</b>, he writes that the soldier bee, the male bee goes and reports to the king. Today we have come to know it is not the king which they report to, it's the queen and the worker bee is not the Male bee, it’s a Female bee.<br><br>Imagine! Qur'an speaks about the gender of the worker bee 1400 years ago, which we have discovered today.</p><hr><h3 id="spider">SPIDER’S WEB / HOME IS FRAGILE</h3><p>The Holy Qur'an says in Surah Ankabut, Chapter No. 29, Verse No 41, that:<br><br><i>“As to those who take for protectors, anyone besides Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala, they build for themselves houses like that of the spider and verily, the house of the spider is fragile, it is delicate”</i></p><div class="reference">{{REF_AR=29:41}}<p class="translation">{{REF_TR=29:41}}</p><div class="footer"><span>{{REF_NAME=29:41}}</span> <span class="sep"></span><a href="https://quranapp.verse.reader/29/41">Open in reader</a></div></div><p>Besides, the Qur'an saying, that anyone who takes for protectors anyone besides Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala, the physical nature of their house will be like that of the spider fragile, delicate, flimsy -it also gives a reference to their family life, which we have to know today, that many a times, the female spider kills the male spider.</p><hr><h3 id="ants">LIFESTYLE AND COMMUNICATION OF ANTS</h3><p>The Qur'an says in Surah Naml, Chapter No. 27, Verse No 17 and 18, that:<br><br><i>“Before Solomon marched, the hosts of Jinns, men and birds, and when they reached a lowly valley of ants, one of the ants said get ye into your habitation, lest Solomon and his horses unknowingly will trample you beneath the feet”</i></p><div class="reference">{{REF_AR=27:17}}<p class="translation">{{REF_TR=27:17}}</p><div class="footer"><span>{{REF_NAME=27:17}}</span> <span class="sep"></span><a href="https://quranapp.verse.reader/27/17">Open in reader</a></div></div><p>People will think… What kind of a fairy tale book is the Holy Qur'an? This book… the Holy Qur'an… it’s speaking about ants... ants talking among themselves, it’s a fairy tale book.<br><br>Today we have come to know that any animal or any insect which has the closest resemblance to that of the human being… it is the ant. The ants bury the dead the same way as the human beings do. They have a sophisticated method and division of labour, where they have a manager, supervisor, workers, etc. They very often meet to chat. They have a sophisticated method of communication. They have market places where they exchange goods. And when they store the grain in winter, and if the grain begins to bud, the ants cut the bud as though they knew that budding will cause rotting of the grain. And in Monsoon, if the grain gets wet, they bring it out in the sunlight to dry. Surely you might have seen the ants carrying grain in the sunlight to dry as though they knew that humidity will cause the development of root system, which will cause rotting of the grain. So Qur'an speaks about the advanced nature of the ants, 1400 years ago.</p>
